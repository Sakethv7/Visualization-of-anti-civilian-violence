# Tableau Dashboard for Anti-Civilian Violence 

## Brief Explanation
The dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for visualizing and analyzing the "Anti-Civilian Violence" dataset from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). It provides interactive and informative visualizations to aid users in understanding global political violence patterns, actor involvement, and the impact on civilian populations.

## The Dataset
**Explanation:** The dataset, sourced from ACLED, captures real-time information on political violence and protest events globally. Key attributes include Event Date, Year, Event Type, Fatalities, Region, Country, Latitude, Longitude, Source, Sub_Event_Type, Disorder_Type, Actors, Iso, Civilian_Targeting, Tags, and Notes. No pre-processing was required for the chosen dataset.



##  Questions
1. What are the locations of events that have happened in a particular region?
2. Which are the safest countries to travel to in Southeast Asia?
3. Which set of regions have the most civilian violences in the 21st Century.
4. What is the trend of occurrences of protests and riots before and after COVID-19 across the globe.
5. What are the events and fatalities caused by different militant organizations in various countries.
6. Which are the militant groups which induce the most fatalities in regions?
7. What is your analysis of the events and the fatalities that took place in various regions.
8. How has the number of conflict events changed over time?
9. What is the distribution of events by event type?
10. What is the frequency of militant group-induced explosions in Europe?

## Interactivity
  Controls:
  1.	Dropdown Menus: Implemented in various sheets, allowing users to select specific countries, regions, or event types for a more focused analysis.
  2.	Range Selection: Utilized in sheets involving temporal data, enabling users to filter events based on specific years or date ranges.
  3.	Colour Intensity Filters: Applied in choropleth maps to represent variations, offering an interactive exploration of explosion quantities and intensity.
  4.	Legend Controls: In charts with legends, users can interactively explore specific event types by toggling them on or off for a clearer visualization.

  Functionality:
  1.	Dynamic Filtering: Dropdown menus provide users with the flexibility to dynamically filter data based on their preferences, enhancing the specificity of the analysis.
  2.	Temporal Exploration: Range selection controls allow users to focus on a particular time frame, facilitating a detailed examination of trends before and after significant events such as COVID-19.
  3.	Geospatial Insight: Colour intensity filters on choropleth maps offer an interactive experience in exploring the frequency of militant group-induced explosions in Europe, with variations in colour     representing different levels of intensity.
  4.	Event Type Selection: Legends in certain charts enable users to interactively explore specific event types, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the dataset.
The incorporation of these interactive elements empowers users to customize their analysis, providing a user-friendly and exploratory experience within the dashboard.
